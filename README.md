## Overview
This repository holds a collection of labs originally developed for CSC 213, the operating systems course at Grinnell College. A description of these labs and experience using them over three sections of CSC 213 will appear at SPLASH-E 2019 in October. A preprint version of that paper is available at <https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~curtsinger/files/splash-e-2019.pdf>.

## Labs
The labs are typically run in the following sequence:

**Worm**  
Implement a simple cooperative multitasking library to run a provided command-line game.

**Password Cracker**  
Write a brute-force password cracker that can invert MD5 hashes.

**Parallel Data Structures**  
Implement and test three thread-safe data structures.

**GPU Warmup**  
Introduction to GPU programming to prepare for the next lab.

**Sudoku**  
Write a GPU-based sudoku solver using constraint propagation.

## Autograders and Solutions
Autograders and solutions are available for some of the labs. I will happily provide these to faculty at other colleges and universities. Please send your request by email.
